<ul>
<li>Double check that ROIConfig.txt is in the <strong>train/Subject1/</strong> directory. </li>
<li>Try again, making sure to select both <strong>train/Subject1/</strong> and <strong>train/traces</strong>. </li>
<li>If your images are in .png format, convert them using the included <strong>png_to_jpg.py</strong> script, by typing <code>python png_to_jpg.py /path/to/png/images</code>. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="-moved-0-images-and-0-traces-after-running-__configdir__">&quot;moved 0 images and 0 traces&quot; after running <strong>Configdir</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li>Most likely you gave the incorrect folder as an argument. You <em>must</em> select the /train directory made by Image Diversity. To do so, navigate <em>into</em> that directory, and then click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-traced-images-wildly-inaccurate-">Final traced images wildly inaccurate.</h2>
<ul>
<li>Look through your training data one image at a time (you can use the Autotrace tool for this), and look for bad traces, and bad images. </li>
<li>Clear the folders and restart the process from the beginning, but this time, during the <strong>Image Diversity</strong> step, use a larger training set, and include more images from the &quot;least diverse&quot; category in the training set.  </li>
</ul>

<li>This is not an error. The program ran successfully! You should have recieved an email indicating that the training process has finished. Use the <code>Ctrl-C</code> key combination to exit. </li>

<ul>
<li>This is also not an error. If you did not input your email for a notification, this message indicates that Train Network has finished running. </li>

<h2 id="roi_config-txt-not-found">ROI_config.txt not found</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>If this error occurs while running TrainNetwork, then ROI_config.txt was not in one of the folders that you selected for training. </p>
</li>
<li><p>If this occurs during AutoTracing, then ROI_config.txt is not in the directory containing your test images. </p>
</li>
