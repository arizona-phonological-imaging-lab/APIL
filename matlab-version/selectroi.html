<blockquote>
<p>This script is designed to help the user select a region of interest
    to use with the set of images selected by the user. The boundaries
    can be set either by clicking and dragging, or with the text entry
    boxes. When this script is run, it will look for a config file called
    ROI_config.txt that specifies the region of interest. If no such file
    exists, it will be created when the user presses &#39;Save&#39;. Saving will
    overwrite any previous information in ROI_config.txt.
    ROI_config.txt will be used by other scripts, such as image_diversity.py,
    Autotrace.py, and TrainNetwork.py.</p>
