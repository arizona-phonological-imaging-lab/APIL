<blockquote>
<p>This script measures the distance from average for each image in the
    input set, and copies the specified number of highest scoring images
    to a new folder called &#39;diverse&#39;. If ROI_config.txt is present in the
    same folder as the input images, the ROI in that file will be used to
    do the measurement. If not present, it will use a hard-coded default ROI.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Open <a href="../image_diversityNEW.py">Image Diversity</a> by typing <code>python image_diversityNEW.py</code></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/image_diversityNEW.png" alt="Image Diversity"></p>
<ul>
<li>Click <em>open</em> by the Select Files field<blockquote>
<p>Note: this program filters so that only images can be selected, and once you click <em>open</em> it may take a while.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>It will then ask for corresponding traces to match the images</li>
<li>Hit <em>open</em> once you have selected the corresponding traces</li>
<li>The main screen tells the number of images selected</li>
<li>Specify the number for training and testing<blockquote>
<p><em>training</em> is the first time it runs through, and then the number you <em>test</em> comes from the <em>training</em> batch</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><p>specify the numer of <em>most diverse</em> and <em>least diverse</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>most diverse</em> will select images that vary greatly in their tongue contours, while <em>least diverse</em> will select images that all have similar tongue contours</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>That will reduce the numbr of overall images based on your specifications</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Select the ratio of <em>most diverse</em> to <em>least diverse</em></li>
<li>From this you can select a <strong>test set</strong>. It is recommended that you use a sample from your most diverse images for testing.</li>
<li><strong>batches for remaining</strong> is simply all of the images that you have not selected to train with, and they will go into a folderentitled <strong>remaining</strong><blockquote>
<p>Note: if an <strong>error</strong> during this part of the process occurs then some settings may be missing</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>Save to your folder of choice</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong></li>
<li>From this a graph will open</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="images/image_diversityNEWgraph.png" alt="Image Diversity Graph"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This shows <strong>Diversity Scores</strong> on the Y axis. Diversity scores will be higher if you have more diverse images and vice versa for least diverse. On the X axis it simply ranks the numbers based on their order.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You can save this graph if you would like or take a screenshot<blockquote>
<p>The program will close automatically when it is done running (T: may not be correct, program has not closed automatically for me yet)</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the folder where you specified to have the images
Note: In this folder there will be several other new folders. <strong>batch remaining</strong> is the folder discussed above. <strong>diversity log</strong> is the record of what happened in the file move. <strong>sorted results</strong> are the scores for each image.</li>
</ul>
