<blockquote>
<p>This manual will explain the process of how to use train a network. This essentially takes a batch of images and their corresponding traces and helps train Autotrace to better predict contours of the tongue.</p>
<p>there are two versions of <strong>Train Network</strong>. For this we will be using <strong>Train Network 2</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>In the <code>Autotrace/matlab-version</code> directory, Launch <strong>Train Network 2</strong> with the following command <code>python TrainNetwork2.py</code></p>
<p><img src="images/TrainNetwork2.png" alt="TrainNetwork2"> </p>
</li>
<li>In the <strong>Data</strong> dropdown menu, specify the training data that is compiled in the folder by clicking on the subject&#39;s folder then clicking <em>open</em><ul>
<li>Be sure to select both the <strong>Subject1</strong> and <strong>traces</strong> folders. </li>
<li>Check that <strong>ROI_config.txt</strong> is in the Subject1/ folder</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Select <strong>send email notification</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This will send an email once the program is done running. It may take hours or even days depending on the system, number of images, an other variables. You should adjust your settings so that your computer does not fall asleep.</p>
<p>For further information on this program and the other programs mentioned above, you should refer to the dissertation by Jeff Berry.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the program finishes running, it will not close automatically. After you see &quot;Saving trained network...done&quot; or the gsmtp code used to send you an email, use ctrl-c to close the script and go back to the command line. </li>
</ul>
