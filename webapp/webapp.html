<p>Under Development!</p>
<p>The Webapp is the next-generation edition of Autotrace. It is designed to be more user-friendly and internally complete than its predecessors</p>
<p>The APIL webapp runs with a client-server paradigm. It runs equally well with the client and server on a single machine, though we encourage you to establish one machind for your lab that is the server, that lab members can log into from afar to do work. This optional central server is hereafter called "Bigmac", because that is the APIL lab's name for our analysis machine that also serves as a server for the webapp</p>
<p>The webapp in its current state has two parts. A tracer, and a database.</p>
