Image Diversity New Manual
===
>This script measures the distance from average for each image in the
	input set, and copies the specified number of highest scoring images
	to a new folder called 'diverse'. If ROI_config.txt is present in the 
	same folder as the input images, the ROI in that file will be used to 
	do the measurement. If not present, it will use a hard-coded default ROI.
